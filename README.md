# 🍷 BottleNeck ETL Pipeline – Kestra Project

This project implements a production-grade, automated ETL workflow for **BottleNeck**, a premium wine distributor. The ETL is built using [Kestra](https://kestra.io), and it orchestrates tasks from ingesting raw Excel files to producing cleaned analytics, premium wine detection, and S3 data exports.

---

## 🚀 Project Context

BottleNeck collects monthly sales, ERP, and mapping data from various systems in Excel format. The objective of this project is to:

- ✅ Automate the ingestion, cleaning, and merging of ERP, Web, and Liaison datasets
- ✅ Compute per-product revenues and identify premium wines using statistical models
- ✅ Export results to Excel and CSV formats
- ✅ Upload final reports to Amazon S3
- ✅ Add robust error handling and monitoring

## 🧠 Problem Statement

The current manual processing of sales data is time-consuming and error-prone. Key issues include:

- ❌ Duplicate records in ERP and Web datasets  
- ❌ No automation for merging, revenue aggregation, or premium flagging  
- ❌ No pipeline to extract and report results  
- ❌ No alerting or dead-letter capture on pipeline failure

##  Output Artifacts

| File Name                     | Description                           |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `revenue_per_product.xlsx`   | Excel report with product & summary    |
| `premium_wines.csv`          | List of premium (vintage) wines        |
| `ordinary_wines.csv`         | Remaining wines                        |

All files are exported to an **S3 bucket** under the `extracts/` prefix.

---

##  Error Handling

This project includes a robust two-layer error-handling system:

1. **Dead Letter S3 Logging**  
   - On failure, the full `execution` context is saved to `s3://my-kestra-bucket/dead-letter/...`

2. **SendGrid Email Alert**  
   - An email is sent to the administrator with the flow ID, execution ID, and failure timestamp.

> These ensure quick diagnostics and pipeline observability in case of failure.

---

##  Data Validations

- ERP cleaned row count must be **825**
- Web cleaned row count must be **714**
- Liaison cleaned row count must be **825**
- Premium wines must equal **30** entries (`z-score > 2`)
- Total revenue must equal exactly **€70,568.60**

##  How to Run

1. Make sure you are in the `bottleneck/` folder.
2. Build the Python Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t kestra-python-deps:latest -f Dockerfile .
```

3. Launch the services:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

4. Go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
5. Import the flow (`p10_kestra_dataflow_orchestration_pipeline`) from the UI or API.
6. Click "Run Flow" to trigger it manually or wait for the monthly cron trigger.
